This is a brief plan of possible future features that I want to add to Ardu Rover.
If you have anything you want to see added, please let me know :)


Ardu Command System:

- Ardu DASS (Direct Arduino Script System) mode
Goes into a scripting mode where the user can create and run scripts on the rover.

- Ardu Command RC mode
Ardu Rover can be driven via bluetooth commands (could be integrated into a control interface)

- Ardu IR RC mode
Ardu Rover can be driven with an IR remote

- Ardu CMD Mission mode
Ardu Rover can be driven and operated using a script.
