For Ardu Rover V1.3.3
Created 21st May 2021

NOTE:
1)Ardu Rover only accepts commands over bluetooth communication.
  I use a blue tooth terminal on my laptop, but it works fine on most compatible BlueTooth terminals on mobile devices

2)Make sure your Bluetooth terminal is set to New Line and not No Line Ending.

3)These commands only work while Ardu Rover is in command promt state.
  Command Promt is active after initializing, and also after the rover has returned home (or at least thinks it's home lol)


Command List:

/Ardu Start
Ardu Rover will begin to search for an IR signal by driving around.
(As of 1.3.3, Ardu Rover can only search in a straight line. This will hopefully change in a future update)

/Ardu Reboot
Runs the currently useless restart function, be aware that this will cause the code to hang (Stop) as Ardu Rover expects to restart.
Requires further debugging, possible patches/ideas welcome.

/Ardu Ping Me
Really just to check that the rover is still connected if you have had to leave it for awhile, or it stops responding.

/Ardu Show Data
Use this command to view the latest data that Ardu Rover collected (returns error if no data, data is also cleared on device reset/power cycle)

/Ardu Rest
Sets the rover to rest mode, not sure if this mode actually saves power as it is, but it will only scan for a command input every 5s

/Ardu Name
Returns the name of the module it got the data from (This is a manually assigned string called devname, to change it, modify the string assignment: String devname = "[Name of device Ardu Rover searches for]";)

/Ardu Rover Version
Returns the version of Ardu Rover that your rover is running
